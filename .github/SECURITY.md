## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of our open-source software.
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities by creating a new issue.
You will receive a response from us within one week at most,
but most probably within a few hours or days.
If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity.
