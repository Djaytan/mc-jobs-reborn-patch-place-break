## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of our open-source software.
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Please disclose privately any suspected security vulnerability by following the steps
mentioned [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
You will receive a response from us within one week at most,
but most probably within a few hours or days.
If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity.
