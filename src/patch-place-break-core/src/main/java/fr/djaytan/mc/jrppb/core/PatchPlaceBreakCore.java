/**
 * This class represents the patch place-break enabler for any consumer. Its role is to manage the
 * patch's lifecycle.
 *
 * <p>When enabling the patch with {@link #enable(ClassLoader, Clock, Path)}, it is ensured to be
 * properly initialized and a {@link PatchPlaceBreakApi} instance is returned to be consumed by the
 * caller.
 *
 * <p>When no longer using the patch, ensure to call the {@link #disable()} method (e.g. on plugin
 * disabling). This will ensure to properly disable the patch (e.g. by closing existing database
 * connections).
 *
 * <p>Only one instance of this class is expected to be run at once.
